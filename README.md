## 🚀 Project Overview
This project predicts wine quality using physico-chemical features and machine learning models. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation.

## 🧩 Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the wine dataset
- Preprocess and standardize features
- Train, tune, and evaluate an XGBoost model
- Visualize key feature importances

## 🛠 Tech stack
- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 📦 XGBoost for model training
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA and visualization
- ⚙️ Scikit-learn for preprocessing, metrics, and pipelines
- 💻 Jupyter Notebook for development and reporting
